# IFF-NET
IFF-Net is dedicated to complete the detection of metal surface defects. The detection accuracy of the algorithm is improved by the proposed MFPN, ASSPPF, and the running time of the algorithm is reduced by the proposed DCConv and DLM, and finally tested on the PASCAL VOC and NEU-DET datasets.
